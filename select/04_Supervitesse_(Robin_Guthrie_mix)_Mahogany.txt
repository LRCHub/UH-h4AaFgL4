Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize, don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel the power
You won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I will close my eyes then I won't see
Love you don't feel when you're holdin' me
Mornin' will come, I will do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
